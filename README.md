# **GAME OF SPOCK**

## <u>1. Introduction</u>
The objective of this project was to create an interactive front-end site that would respond to a user's actions using Javascript, HTML and CSS. Game of Spock is an extension of the popular Rock, Paper, Scissors game that the user can play against the computer. The difference with the Game of Spock is that it has four extra options: Lizard, Spock, Love and Devil. Lizard and Spock are game options that were made popular by the TV programme 'The Big Bang Theory' and form the 'Easy Spock' level of the game with five options to choose from. Love and Devil options are for the 'Hard Devil' level to the game where there are seven options to choose from. The site is targeted towards players who want to play an extended version of the traditional Rock, Paper, Scissors game and play online against the Computer.

## <u>2. User Stories</u>
As a user who wants to learn and play an extension of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game, I want to navigate the game page with minimum effort and easily understand how to play the game from the instructions. I want to be able to have fun playing against the computer and try and beat it with a higher score.

### **End user goal:** 
To understand the rules of the Game of Spock and to try and beat the Computer in the Game of Spock with a higher score.

### **Acceptance criteria:**
The landing page to include instructions to the rules of the Game of Spock.
An input box for the user to choose a username before they progress to the game itself.
The user can choose between different levels of difficulty.
A scoreboard that keeps track of the score.
A message that indicates whether the user has won, lost or drawn each round of the game.

### **Measurement of success:**
A landing page with clear instructions explaining to the user before they get onto the game page what the rules of the game are. 
A simple input section for the user to input their username on the landing page. The chosen username to be instantly implemented onto the game page and for the user to be taken there directly having clicked the submit button.
A user can choose between difficulty levels easily that will add to the enjoyment of the game by the user. 
When the user chooses an option, a result message will display immediately to inform the user as to whether the result is a win, lose or draw, and the scoreboard will update immediately depending on the result. There will be an acknowledgement of the choice chosen and the score updating using a visual display of colour and/or audio.
The game will be fully responsive from large to small mobile screen widths.

## <u>3. Features</u>

### **Header**
There is a fixed header featured on both the landing page and game page with the game title displayed.

### <i>**Landing page**</i>

### **Rules images**
There is one image that shows the rules for the Easy Spock level of the game using the five choices of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock and Lizard. The second image to the right shows the rules of the game for the Hard Devil level of the game, with the Love and Devil choices added to the five choices of the Easy Spock level.

### **Username input box**
There is a clearly indicated input box underneath the rules images for the user to enter their username for the game.

### **Level options**
There are two level options, Easy Spock and Hard Devil, to the game. The user must click one of the options to proceed to the game page.

### <i>**Game page**</i>

### **Username and computer name**
The user's chosen username will be displayed on the left side of the page, and the Computer's name is displayed on the right.

![join-us-page](docs/screenshots/join-us-page.png "Join Us page")

### **Scoreboard**
The scoreboard is positioned in the middle of the screen, with the scores updating as the user plays the game. The player's score in the scoreboard will light up in a green colour when the user wins a round, and the computer's score will light up in red when the user loses. For a drawn game, there are no colours displayed.

   ![tennis-courts-page-4](docs/screenshots/tennis-courts-page-4.png "Tennis Courts page 4")

### **Results message**
The user will be greeted with the message "Ready?" when they first land on the game page. This will then display three different types of messages as the user plays the game, one each for winning, losing or drawing a round against the computer.

### **User choices for game**
For the Easy Spock game, the user will have five choices to choose from between Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard and Spock. For the Hard Devil level, there will be the addition of the Love and Devil choices. These choices will be represented by icons towards the bottom of the screen. There is also a "Make your move" message below the choices to indicate to the user that they have to click on a choice.

## <u>4. Future features</u>

### **Sets of games**
A feature that allows the user to play to a set high number, for example the first to reach 21 points. Then a separate scoreboard to keep track of the amount of sets the player has won or lost against the computer. This will add an extra layer of competitiveness to the game and overall enjoyment to the user. 

### **Two player game**
Include an option for two users to play against each other instead of the game being a one player game against the computer. This additional feature would look to split the screen and for the controls for user choices to be input through the keyboard.

### **Timer**
To add a timer element to the game. This could be achieved by either adding a countdown timer before the player makes a choice each time, for example a 3, 2, 1 countdown. Or a countdown timer for the user to try and beat the computer before the timer reaches zero. This feature could work nicely alongside the "Sets of games" feature mentioned earlier.

## <u>5. Typography and color scheme</u>
I chose a dark background and a light pink colour scheme. I wanted to associate the colour scheme to Star Trek and the acknowledgement of Spock as being a main part of the game. The dark background has an added "galaxy/space" effect with tiny specks of white light to represent distant galaxies and the night sky. The light pink is a nice contrast to the dark background and makes the text legible. There is also a light blue colour that's used that gives an extra layer of aesthetics to the site and again is very legible against the dark background. The main font is "press start 2p" which is reminiscent of the 1990s arcade games, this is only used for the game title and text that are large enough so that it's easy to read. For scoreboard text and messages this is in "space grotesk" font which is easier to read for the user and keeps with the "space" theme.

## <u>6. Wireframes</u>
Wireframes were created using Balsamiq to outline what the site would look like, from the layout of the Landing page to the Game page and updating scoreboard and results messages. I've also outlined the layout for desktop and mobile screen widths.

## <u>8. Testing</u>

   ### **Code validation**
   HTML and CSS. No errors were found when the codes were put through the [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/) for HTML and [Jigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) for CSS.

   JavaScript.

   ### **Test cases (user story based with screenshots)**

   #### **Desktop**

   ##### Landing page
   As the user is on the landing page, the user is shown the game title in the header, and two images underneath with the rules of the game. There is a message that informs the user to enter a username in a text box, where the pointer is focused on the text box already as the landing page loads. The user is also presented with two options below to choose a difficulty level for the game, Easy Spock and Hard Devil. The user must enter a username and choose a level in order to progress to the game page.

   ![nav-bar-highlight](docs/screenshots/home-button-highlight.png "Nav bar highlight")

   ![social-media-link-highlight](docs/screenshots/twitter-highlight.png "Social media link highlight")

   ##### Game page
   When the user gets to the game page, the username that was typed into the text box on the landing page will appear on the left side of the screen. In between the username and computer name, there is a scoreboard that indicates the scores for the player and the computer. Underneath the scoreboard is a "Ready?" message, the choices the user needs to make which are represented as icons, and another message to promt the user to make the first move to start the game. When the user hovers over the icons, the icons will "pop" out and is highlighted with a blue border. When the user clicks on a choice, the game starts immediately and the score will automatically update and the results message will appear to show the user whether they have won that round or not. If the user has won a round, the user's score in the scoreboard will light up green. If the user has lost the round, the computer's score in the scoreboard will light up red. If it's a draw, it will only be indicated through the results message.

   ![join-us-error-message](docs/screenshots/join-us-error-message.png "Join us page error message")

   #### **Mobile** 
   Within a screensize width of 390px, the tennis ball home button in the header disappears on all pages. The navigation bar is pushed to the top left of the screen. On the Home page the four steps in the How it Works section are stacked on top of each other. In the London tennis courts section the maps are stacked below their corresponding text information. All links and icons work as they did for the desktop width.
